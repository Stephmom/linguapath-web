# LinguaPath

LinguaPath is a lightweight English-practice website for Cambridge Linguaskill learners. It runs as a static site—there is no build step or package manager.

**Live site:** https://stephmom.github.io/linguapath-web/

## Features

- Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking practice
- Tier progression based on correct answers
- Daily practice goal, streaks, review history, and achievements
- Daily motivational quotes and a randomized three-minute warm-up
- Light and dark themes, with a mouse-reactive particle background
- Email sign-in and cloud-synced student progress using Supabase

## Run locally

From the repository root, start a small local web server:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000. A local server is recommended because the app loads its question and quote data from JSON files.

## Supabase setup

The site uses Supabase Auth and the `student_progress` table to keep each signed-in learner’s progress separate and available across devices.

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. In the Supabase SQL Editor, run [`supabase.sql`](supabase.sql) to create the progress table and row-level security policies.
3. In `supabase-auth.js`, set `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` to your project URL and **publishable** key.
4. Enable email sign-in in Supabase Auth. Configure the site URL and allowed redirect URLs for your deployed site (and `http://localhost:8000` for local testing).
5. Deploy the site and test account creation, sign-in, sign-out, and progress syncing.

The publishable key is intended for browser use; database access is restricted by the row-level security policies. Never put a Supabase `service_role` or other secret key in this repository or in browser code.

## Deploy with GitHub Pages

The live site is served from the repository’s `main` branch. To publish changes, push or merge them to `main`, then check the repository’s **Settings → Pages** to confirm the Pages source is configured for the branch and root folder. GitHub Pages publishes the static files; no build command is needed.
